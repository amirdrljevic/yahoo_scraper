This scraper app uses Selenium to scrape the information from the Yahoo Finance website. 

The prerequisites for this script to run are:
* Ruby 3 installed, 
* Google chrome drive,

After all the prerequisites have been installed, please run `bundle install`

## Running the script

_symbols like AMZN, JNJ, PG, PFE, TWTR, FB, TSLA, ETSY, etcâ€¦_

> Please, bear in mind that sometimes, due to slow network connection, script fails. Just rerun the script again in that case.
> For that reason I have increased the sleep time to wait for the elements to load.  

The script will scrape the following information, as requested:
into table companies:
* full company name,
